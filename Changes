        The calculation of the "localepoch" for specified timezone
        is now accurate, hopefully.
        'location' can now be a nameplace as well as lat/lon coordinates.
        Pod additions.

        Hopefully fixed a bug in testing where I did not take into
        account different timezones in host machines.
        In tests, gotten and expected results will not be compared
        using is_deeply()
        if perl was compiled with uselongdouble flag because the
        extra accuracy fails the comparisons. All other checks will be made.
        A range check would be more suitable but there are also strings
        containing numbers. So this is not going to change soon.
